# Database Fundamentals

## Introduction to Databases
- What is a database?
- Purpose and importance of databases
- Types of databases (relational, NoSQL, etc.)

## Data Models
- Hierarchical data model
- Network data model
- Relational data model
- Object-oriented data model
- NoSQL data models (key-value, document, column-family, graph)

## Relational Database Concepts
- Tables, rows, and columns
- Data types
- Keys (primary, foreign, candidate, composite)
- Relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Integrity constraints (entity, referential, domain)

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)
- What is a DBMS?
- Types of DBMS (relational, NoSQL, in-memory, etc.)
- Popular DBMS examples (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis)

## Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Introduction to SQL
- SQL syntax and statements (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)
- Creating, modifying, and dropping database objects
- Querying data (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY)
- Updating and deleting data
- Advanced SQL concepts (subqueries, views, stored procedures, triggers, etc.)

## Database Design
- Database design process
- Conceptual, logical, and physical design
- Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling
- Database normalization
- Denormalization and its use cases

## Database Transactions
- ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Transaction control statements (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
- Concurrency control and locking mechanisms
- Isolation levels

## Database Security
- Authentication and authorization
- User roles and permissions
- Data encryption and security best practices

## Database Performance and Optimization
- Indexing strategies
- Query optimization techniques
- Caching and memory management
- Partitioning and sharding
- Load balancing and replication

## Database Administration
- Backup and recovery strategies
- Database monitoring and maintenance
- Database replication and high availability
- Database migration and upgrades

## Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence
- Data warehousing concepts
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
- OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
- Data mining and analytics

## NoSQL Databases
- Introduction to NoSQL databases
- Key-value databases (Redis, Memcached)
- Document databases (MongoDB, Couchbase)
- Column-family databases (Cassandra, HBase)
- Graph databases (Neo4j, ArangoDB)
- Use cases and advantages of NoSQL databases

## Database Integration and APIs
- Database connectivity (JDBC, ODBC, ADO.NET)
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools
- Database APIs and RESTful web services
